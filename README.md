# Football Player Cards W/ Modern JavaScript

This project allows you to filter football player cards by their position and nickname. It was created in the FreeCodeCamp.org JavaScript and Algorithms course for Modern JavaScript Methods.

I was able to review DOM manipulation, object destructuring, event handling and data filtering. The project also covered switch statements, default parameters, `Object.freeze()`, and `.map()`.
